# MSc Synthetic Population Generation using Diffusion Models - A case study in Denmark

This project utilised Generative Adversarial Networks to generate a representative Population of Denmark.
The usecase for such population is the SimMobility Platform that models and simulates traffic scenarios in Denmark.

## Installation

DATGAN and ciDATGAN is publicly available on: https://github.com/glederrey/DATGAN
Setup file is incldued.

## Usage

The project is separated in multiple dedicated notebooks and python scripts.
The WGAN, DATGAN and ciDATGAN can be used wit the respected jupyter notebooks.

To run DATGAN and ciDATGAN succesfully it is needed to follow the order of:
0. Get acces to data
1. Pre Processing
- Check requirements of usecase and GAN inputs
- Check Numerical Values
2. GANs-Preparation
- Setup Data types, Directed Acyclic Graphs, etc.
- Preprocess Datatypes with DATGAN lib
3. DatGan/ciDatGan
- Load Data information
- Load Preprossing Data from DATGAN lib (Define conditionals for ciDATGAN)
- Train Model 
4. Sample Data
- Define Number of Samples (Define condionts for ciDATGAN)



## Results

The dolfer Datasets_reuslts holds all model results.
The folder 'Populations processed for SImMobility' holds the post processed datasets for SimMobility
